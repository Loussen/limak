                                    <p>Currently, our company is engaged in cargo transportations only from Turkey.
Deliveries on orders to Baku are carried out twice a week. Our fares for transportations
                                        from Turkey are much more profitable compared to the fares of other companies.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>Limak offers affordable deliveries at prices from $2.5 to $5.5, 
                                        depending on the weight of the package.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>The delivery fee for an ordered package is calculated by its weight.

                                        weight.
